Little Mr.
=========

"Little Mr." is a lonely man who has a square head. å›§

It is for my girlfriend as a new year's gift. Of course, it is not the final version. Because the final version is only for my girlfriend. This version is only tested in Mac OS X. But it also should work fine in Windows and Linux.

There are some preferences in ```config.txt```. Every line is a preference. Note: After ```:```, there is NOT space. And use ```UTF-8```.

In ```map.txt```, it is communication pair for "Little Mr.". You can add something by yourself or by saying "KEYWORDS means ANSWER" in application. Before ```:```, it's the key word for "question". When there is ```&&``` between two key words. These two key words must appear at the same time in one sentence. After ```:```, it's the key for "answer". There are some special words for "answer":

+ ```!master_name```: user's name
+ ```!my_name```: "Little Mr."!!
+ ```\n```: return (change line)
+ ```!time```: show the time (hour:minute:second)
+ ```!day```: show the day (year.month.day)

Note: There are NOT space after ```&&``` and ```:``` and before ```&&```. And use ```UTF-8```.

In the ```data``` folder, there are some files which will not be changed when runing. Files whos names are ```bgN.png``` are background figures. (They are drawed by myself. :-D) In ```begin_text.txt```, there are some sentences which "Little Mr." will speak at the beginning. In ```press_text.txt```, there are some sentences which "Little Mr." will speak when user press the mouse. In ```stay_text.txt```, there are some sentences which "Little Mr." will speak when he feel lonely. Above special words are also suitable for ```stay_text.txt```, ```press_text.txt``` and ```begin_text.txt```.
